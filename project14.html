            <h1>MY FAVOURITE HOBBY</h1>
            <p>My favourite hobby is reading. I love to read a lot. My dad always buys me a lot of books to read which makes me very happy. I also want to be able to read a novel within a day as others do. But I have been able to read a novel in a week,which makes me proud of myself.</p>
            <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
            <p>The reason why i love to read books is because,it sharpens and train my brain. It makes me feel very smart in class. It also makes me to attend to questions very fast in class. It makes me very brilliannt too. It helps me to learn more words.</p>
